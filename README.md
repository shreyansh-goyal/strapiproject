 # Docker Implementation
 The docker file is pretty self-explanantory. The backend is deployed in one docker file with port 1337 and 3306 exposed. This setup is currently hosted on the herokuapp @ https://glacial-ravine-52971.herokuapp.com/admin/login. In furture it will be self hosted on the BPIT infrastructure.
